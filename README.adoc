== CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions workflows for automated building and deployment:

=== Build Workflow
On push to the `develop` branch or pull requests to `develop`, a GitHub workflow validates that:

* Localized pages are generated successfully
* JavaScript, CSS and HTML files can be minified
* JavaScript and CSS can be inlined into HTML
* All required files are present for deployment

This ensures that changes can be deployed before merging to main.

=== Deploy Workflow
On commit to the `main` branch, a GitHub workflow is activated that:

* Generates localized pages
* Minifies JavaScript, CSS and HTML files
* Inlines JavaScript and CSS into the HTML
* Pushes an incremental update to the webspace at {homepage}

== Development

=== Setup

Pull the repository in a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers[VSCode Devcontainer].
The container configures itself and provides launch configurations for local development.

=== Running Locally

The project includes launch configurations and tasks for local development:

==== Launch Configuration
Use the launch configuration *"Run: generate + php + open browser"* to:

* Generate localized pages from JSON files
* Start a local PHP development server
* Automatically open the homepage in your default browser

==== Manual Tasks
Alternatively, you can run individual tasks from the task list:

* `generate` - Generate localized pages
* `start-php-server` - Start the PHP development server
* `prepare-and-run` - Complete workflow with browser opening
* `prepare-and-run-no-open` - Complete workflow without opening browser

=== Localizations

To generate localizations of the page, run `/generator/generate.py`.

The localization process:

1. Reads text content from language-specific JSON files in `/generator/` (`de.json`, `en.json`)
2. Inserts the content into `/generator/template.html`
3. Matches placeholders for each language
4. Outputs localized HTML pages in language-specific directories (`de/`, `en/`)

=== Bootstrap Version Management

Bootstrap version is centrally managed in `.bootstrap-version` (currently: `{bootstrap-version}`).

To update Bootstrap:

1. Update `.bootstrap-version` with the new version number
2. Run: `python3 update-bootstrap.py`
3. This downloads and updates `styles/bootstrap-full.css` and `scripts/bootstrap-full.js`
